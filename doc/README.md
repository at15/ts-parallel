## TODO

### in memory database tuple representation

- need to figure out what data structure to use if we want to have a row based representation
  - it's quite simple to have column based representation, just an map of arrays
- http://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2017/slides/02-inmemory.pdf
  - operator at a time (instead of tuple at a time)
  - vector at a time
- https://hpi.de/fileadmin/user_upload/fachgebiete/plattner/teaching/TrendsandConcepts/2010/Krueger_DataStructuresForIMDBs.pptx.pdf
  - talks about row vs column, encoding etc.
- seems need to allocate a large array and use index instead of using `std:tuple`

### comparison

InfluxDB (if it supports the query)

Druid (if I can set it up)
